## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
For this project I have used the data available on the IBM Watson Studio platform provided by Udacity in order to design an exploratory data analysis and build a recommendation system by answering the following questions:

##### I. Exploratory Data Analysis
##### II. Rank Based Recommendations
##### III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
##### IV. Matrix Factorization
##### V. Extras & Concluding

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
### Article interactions data: data/user-item-interactions.csv
* article_id (float64) - article id
* title (str) - article title
* email (str) - article email

### Articles data : data/articles_community.csv
* doc_body	 (str) - article body 
* doc_description (str) - article description
* doc_full_name (str) - article full name
* doc_status (str) - article status
* article_id (int64) - article id

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
I would like to give credit to IBM for the database used for this study and to Udacity for all the code techniques learning through the Data Science program. 
Feel free to use my code and maybe take a look at the blog post mentioned above.
